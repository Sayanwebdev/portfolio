  <h3>Building a Prepaid Energy Meter using ESP32 ⚡</h3>
  <p class="date">Published: October 2025</p>
  <p>
    In this project, I developed a <strong>smart prepaid energy metering system</strong> using the ESP32 microcontroller. 
    The system accurately measures real-time power consumption with the help of <strong>current and voltage sensors</strong> 
    and automatically deducts credit based on energy usage. Once the prepaid balance reaches zero, 
    the power supply is automatically disconnected to prevent overuse.
  </p>
  <p>
    To enhance functionality, I integrated <strong>IoT connectivity</strong> that allows users to 
    monitor their energy consumption and remaining balance through a <strong>cloud dashboard</strong>. 
    The system also supports <strong>online recharge</strong> features and real-time alerts via 
    <strong>Firebase or Blynk</strong> platforms. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates how IoT and automation can make energy billing more transparent, 
    efficient, and user-friendly, particularly in smart home and industrial applications.
